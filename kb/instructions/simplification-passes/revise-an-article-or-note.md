# Revise an article or note

Make the artifact serve the operator's stated purpose without changing what it
claims, by assessing first and then running only the passes the assessment
recommends.

## Prerequisites

- A purpose in one line: who the reader is and what they should notice or be
  able to do. If the operator named only the artifact, propose the purpose
  at the top of the assessment and proceed under it; the operator corrects
  it if it is wrong.
- The artifact's claims are settled. A claim in dispute goes to the operator
  as a question, not into a pass.

## Steps

1. **Assess before editing.** Read the whole artifact. Report a ranked list
   of changes, highest value against the purpose first, each with its cost
   in one phrase and the pass from this directory that would make it. Name
   the sentence a hostile reviewer would attack first. Say what reads well
   in one sentence. Recommend only passes whose value against the purpose
   is clear; an item you would not defend is not recommended. Do not edit.

   Two things the passes cannot own belong in the assessment too. For each
   candidate overclaim, propose whether the sentence is support (may be
   narrowed) or divergence (defend); the divergence items become the
   packets' `Defend:` line unless the operator objects. And list
   qualifications that have gone stale against the body: a scope bullet
   qualifying words the body no longer uses, a table cell filed under the
   wrong row, a cross-note ordinal pointing at the wrong list. These are
   claim questions for the operator, applied as their own commits after
   approval, not passes.

2. **Dispatch each recommended pass as a packet.** Proceed without waiting;
   the report gives the operator the chance to interrupt. Run passes one at a time,
   since they share one write scope. Each pass file carries an `effort`
   field: `simple` passes run in a fresh worker on a cheaper model or lower
   effort; `judgment` passes run on the session model, in the current
   context or a fresh worker. Use a fresh worker when the pass benefits from
   not having seen the conversation, as the figurative-phrasing and
   readability passes do; run narrow-overclaims in the parent context, where
   the conversation is the evidence. Apply one-word swaps and two-sentence
   narrowings in the parent context rather than as packets. Small scoped
   edits from different passes may share one packet when its scope is
   enumerated. The packet is:

   ```
   Purpose: {the operator's one line}
   Artifact: {path}
   Pass: kb/instructions/revising-instructions/{pass}.md
   Defend: {claims the operator has marked as divergence; a pass may not narrow them}
   Write scope: {the artifact only | none, return proposals}
   Return: the pass's report, plus items noticed but not applied, nothing committed
   ```

   The worker chooses means within the pass. It does not widen the write
   scope, add claims, or remove evidence.

3. **Integrate.** After each pass read the diff, and read every replaced
   phrase in its full sentence, not in the diff summary; a literal
   replacement can supply a referent the original left implicit and supply
   the wrong one. Run `commonplace-validate` on the artifact, and commit the
   pass alone with a body saying what it was meant to make true. If the operator reverts part of a pass, record the
   threshold they applied in the pass file or a memory, so the next run
   starts from it.

4. **Stop when the recommended passes are done.** Report what each pass
   changed. Items you assessed but did not recommend, and the not-applied
   items the workers returned, are listed once, not run.

## Budget

- The assessment is one full read. Each pass is one more. Do not re-read
  linked notes unless a pass names them.
- A worker gets the artifact path and the packet, never the conversation.
- Propose-only work (the assessment, the figurative-phrasing list, title
  proposals) may run in parallel; edits to the artifact run in sequence.
- Stop when the recommended passes are done. An item not recommended costs
  nothing; recommending a pass of unclear value costs a read and a diff.

## Verify

- Every applied change traces to a recommended pass.
- No claim, evidence, or qualification changed unless the operator asked.
- Each pass has its own commit and validation passed before it.
- Operator reverts have been recorded as thresholds.

- [Intent-framed delegation is a control regime; prompt length does not establish it](../../notes/intent-framed-delegation-is-a-control-regime-not-a-short-prompt.md) — rests-on: the packet fixes purpose, bounds, and return; the worker chooses means
- [An author should fix what the executor can't determine, not what it will](../../notes/fix-what-the-executor-cant-determine-not-what-it-will.md) — rests-on: why the passes state outcomes and preservation rules rather than edit sequences
