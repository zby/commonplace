[Andrej Karpathy talks about "Claws"](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/2024987174077432126). Andrej Karpathy tweeted a mini-essay about buying a Mac Mini ("The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused") to tinker with Claws:

> I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically [...] But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.
>
> Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. [...]
>
> Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). [...]
>
> Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.

Andrej has an ear for fresh terminology (see [vibe coding](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/), [agentic engineering](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/11/glm-5/)) and I think he's right about this one, too: "Claw" is becoming a term of art for the entire category of OpenClaw-like agent systems - AI agents that generally run on personal hardware, communicate via messaging protocols and can both act on direct instructions and schedule tasks.

It even comes with an established emoji 🦞
