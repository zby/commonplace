# Work

Experimental workshop space. Purpose-driven working artifacts that haven't crystallized into notes yet.

Each workshop is a directory exploring a specific workflow end-to-end: from question through sourcing and extraction to finished notes. The goal is to discover what patterns actually emerge from use, rather than designing structure upfront.

## Active Workshops

- [ingestion-and-deep-search/](./ingestion-and-deep-search/) — rethinking how sources get analysed and how analysis instructions flow from the caller
