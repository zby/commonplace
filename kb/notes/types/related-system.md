# {System name}

{One-paragraph summary — what it is, what it's for, who built it.}

**Repository:** {URL}

## Core Ideas

{What the system does and why. Focus on design choices, not feature lists. Each idea should be a bolded phrase followed by explanation — makes scanning easier.}

## Comparison with Our System

{Where we align, where we diverge, and why the divergences matter. Tables work well for dimension-by-dimension comparisons. Name the trade-offs honestly — neither system is uniformly better.}

## Borrowable Ideas

{Concrete things we could adopt — structures, patterns, framings, mechanisms. For each, note what it would look like in our system and what would need to change. Mark whether it's ready to borrow now or needs a use case first.}

## What to Watch

- {How might this system evolve in ways that affect our design?}
- {What experiments are they running that we'd learn from?}
