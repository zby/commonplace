# {Claim as title — an assertion, not a topic label}

{Opening paragraph — claim stated as a full sentence with context. Why does this matter?}

## Evidence

{Observations, facts, references. Checkable.}
{Toulmin: grounds}

## Reasoning

{The principle connecting evidence to claim. Why does this evidence imply this claim?}
{Toulmin: warrant + backing}

## Caveats

- {Scope limits — when does this not apply?}
- {Assumptions that must hold}
- {Counterarguments and responses}
